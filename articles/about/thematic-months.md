## About this project

Thematic Months is a monthly project where we focus on one Activist Handbook Chapter per month. During the month, participants write articles on the topic(s) related to the theme of the month, there's a video recorded discussion and other activities such as a workshop or a casual get-together. We invite people and organisations who are interested in these themes. This would be a great opportunity to collaborate with like-minded changemakers. We would be delighted to have you onboard for this project.

### These are the ways in which you can participate:

-   Write an article(s)
-   Participate in our podcast episode or Livestream
-   Organise a workshop together with us
