We are currently working on developing the following two courses:

-   [**Web development for rebels**](/academy/web-dev)
-   **Content course**

## Free to join

All our courses are completely free to follow. However, _because the courses take a lot of time and energy from our volunteers to develop, we ask participants to commit beforehand they will attend all workshop sessions._

For those who cannot follow the workshops, we make all course materials publicly available.

> We are able to offer these courses thanks to the generous contributions of fellow rebels, who are willing to share their experience and knowledge with us. If you would also like to become a trainer, [let us know](mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org).

## Accessible for everyone

Our courses are made so that everyone can follow along. All you need to join our courses is a motivation to learn.

We encourage people of all genders, sexual preferences and ethnic backgrounds, including people with disabilities, to join our courses.
