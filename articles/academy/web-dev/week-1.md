**In this session, you will learn about the basics of web development. We'll talk about what you can expect from this course, share some useful resources for self-learning and install a few useful tools. After this session, you will understand better how websites work, be able to write in Markdown and share code using Git.**

> Like all articles on Activist Handbook, we encourage everyone to make improvements! Just create an account to start editing.
> 
> Unlike the rest of this website, these articles are written in Markdown, instead of using the visual editor. That way, you can get to practice using Markdown.
