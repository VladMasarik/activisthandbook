## Installations

No installations are required for this week. We recommend you to use VS Code to try out writing some HTML. You can just open the webpages you create in any browser that you prefer.

Before next Sunday, work together with your fellow students and prepare the following:

-   Turn the markdown files of last week into HTML files.
-   Improve the guide by looking up more info about HTML and CSS.
-   Share all of this in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/activisthandbook/web-dev-course).
