Anti-oppression work is a practice aimed at tackling socioeconomic oppression in individuals' lives and work - including but not limited to activists, our organisations, and our activism. It is an intersectional approach based on reducing the destructive influence that power and privelege can have unless we are consciously committed to minimising its negative effects.
