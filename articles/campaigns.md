**Welcome to Campaigns, the chapter where we write about specific causes that Activist Handbook audience finds important. These articles are so called “Landing pages” where people get introduced to our regular chapters which have a more general application.**

> By organising our content based on causes, we make it easier for activists to find our handbook. People usually tend to look up cause-related search terms, so with these landing pages we make sure get to the high quality content, without having to know exactly what to search for.
