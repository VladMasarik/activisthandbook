**What does overturn Roe v. Wade means for judicial activism?**

### **What is Roe v. Wade?**

Roe v. Wade is a historical case between Norman McCovey, known as Jane Roe, an unmarried pregnant woman, and Henry Wade, her local district attorney. The event began in Texas and was taken to court in 1973. Norman McCovey filed a suit on behalf of herself and others to challenge Texas abortion laws. The court ruled in favor of Norman McCovey, finding that a clause in the 14th amendment of The United States’ constitution protects a pregnant woman’s freedom to choose whether or not to have an abortion.

Many federal and state laws banning abortion in the United States were reversed as a result of this judgment, making abortion legal under many circumstances. Norman McCovey sparked a national debate in the U.S. regarding whether or not abortion should be allowed and to what extent, who should decide its legality and what moral and religious beliefs should play a role in policy making.

## 2022 Developments

### **June 24th**

On June 24th 2022, the U.S.’ Supreme Court officially overturned Roe v. Wade declaring that the constitutional right to abortion no longer exists. What does this mean? It means that all U.S. states are free to choose whether or not their citizens have access to abortion.

### **Judicial activism**

When the Supreme Court initially made public its ruling in Roe, there wasn't much of a public response. However, it became an important topic in American politics in the decades that followed. Some people see the Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court as "judicial activism," which means tha the judges made the judgement based on their own beliefs rather than the law at the time. However, proponents of Roe assert that it is essential for upholding women's rights.

### **Protests spread across the world.**

This year, thousands gathered in The U.S. capital, marching in rain and risking arrest to protest over the reversal of abortion rights. Roe v. Wade not only affects The U.S.’ citizens lives, but also affects many people around the world. Thousands of Australians protested on July 2nd against the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of women’s constitutional rights to abortion. Moreover, protesters in Paris chanted against the U.S. Supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and for the protection of abortion rights.
