**The animal rights movement is vast and diverse. It covers a wide variety of causes from liberating animals in captivity to changing dietary habits. This page covers how to organise for animal rights.**

In the guide you will find some tips and relevant resources on how to get started as animal rights activist. For example, check out our article about how to [organise a protest or demonstration](/organising/protest). We also have a chapter that will help you to [speak up](/communication) about this issue online and in the media

Most groups rely on volunteers to carry out their work, all with busy lives next to their activist lives, so it is important to [take care of your fellow rebels](/wellbeing) and avoid burnout.

There are many ways to contribute to the animal rights moment, from organising actions to [fundraising](/organising/finance) to promoting the group online. We recommend you find something you are good at, and get together a larger group of people with a diverse set of skills.

However, you do not have to limit yourself to what you already have experience with. Activism is always a learning process. If you're looking for training, then consider joining a [workshop](/trainings) offered by experienced campaigners.

## Action ideas

here are some creative action ideas that animal rights activists can use to build power and stand strong against companies and industries that harm animals:

**Organize a "vigil" for animals:** This is a tactic where activists come together to mourn and remember the animals that have been harmed or killed by industries such as factory farming, animal testing, or trophy hunting. This can be a powerful and emotional way to engage with the public and to draw attention to your cause.

**Host a "vegan potluck":** This is a tactic where animal rights activists come together to share vegan food and recipes, and to educate and engage with the public about the benefits of a vegan diet. This can be a fun and engaging way to promote your campaign message and to build support for your cause.

**Create a "guerrilla theater" performance:** This is a tactic where activists use performance art and theater to draw attention to their cause and engage with the public. For an animal rights campaign, this could involve creating a short play or skit that portrays the struggles and challenges faced by animals, and using it to educate and engage with the public.

**Organize a "die-in":** This is a tactic where activists lie down on the ground in public places, such as shopping malls or street corners, to symbolize the death of animals due to industries such as factory farming or animal testing. This can be a powerful and attention-grabbing way to promote your campaign message and to engage with the public.
