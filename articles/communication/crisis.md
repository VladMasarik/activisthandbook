In this guide, we explain how to communicate internally and to the outside world in a crisis situation.

## Summary

-   Explain what people need to know first
    
-   Give specific directions for what they need to do
    
-   Add a personal touch, so people will engage
    
-   Make sure your audience will hear your message
    

_A crisis is happening and you have decided you need to communicate about it to your peers, your partners, your community and/or the public – what do you need to remember when preparing it? A large part of successful crisis management is about communication, and careless communication is what can often make a crisis worse, so this checklist will help you make sure not to forget anything in this stressful time._

## **1\. Be brief**

-   Have you started by giving us a very quick headline of what you are going to tell us?
    
-   What’s new and what do we need to know first?
    
-   Are we making it clear what is specific to our community? 
    
-   What kind of updates will you give in the future and where can we find them? 
    

## **2\. Focus on the facts**

-   Have we given specific directions for what people need to do (even if right now they do not need to do anything)?
    
-   If there are some things we do not know the full details of yet – have we made that clear? 
    
-   Have we put a date on the communication? 
    
-   Have we made sure not to over-promise?
    
-   If we have included links to other resources, have we been clear why someone should click on them? 
    

## **3\. Stay human**

-   Who is this communication coming from? How are we using ‘we/us’ and how are we using ‘you’?
    
-   Have we admitted if things are difficult?
    
-   Is it possible to add a personal touch?
    

## **4\. Test it from your audience’s perspective**

-   Have we got at least one person who did not make the draft to read it?
    
-   Have we walked through the steps that our audience will take to see/hear this message?
    
-   How are we proactively going to make sure it reaches the people who need to see it?
