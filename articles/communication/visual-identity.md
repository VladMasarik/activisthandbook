**In this article, you will learn how to design a visual identity for your activist movement. By creating a design handbook for your communication team, your movement will look more professional and consistent on social media, your website and all other visual representations.**

## Visual Identity

**Why is visual identity important:** Visual identity is an important part of any movement's marketing strategy. It needs to be recognisable, simple and memorable.

**What should be included in the design of a visual identity for activist groups?** _Talk about how to design an activist movement logo, colours._

-   The logo of an activist movement should be simple and iconic in order to be easily recognisable and memorable. It should include the name of the movement and a symbol that represents its core values.
-   It is important to choose the colours carefully. They should match the values of the movement, but also be able to stand out against other logos in a crowded space.
-   The language used in the design of the logo should also reflect its core values

## Colours

### Create a Unique Palette

One good way to ensure professionalism is through use of colours for a certain purpose. Palettes are a colour scheme for social media posts, aimed at standardizing background and text colours. Using these ensures that there’s a throughline between related posts, such as using a certain palette (with associated colours) for a single campaign or event.

Using palettes is good practice in creating more of a brand identity. Palettes also ensure that colours used in a post largely work together, and don’t create any unfortunate difficulties, especially for those with visual disabilities

-   Used as the main colour, usually for the background of the post
-   Used as the secondary colour, often for secondary headlines
-   Used as accent colours, for bolded words, underlines, text boxes, etc
-   White, black, or one of the palette colours can be used as

### **Selecting Colours**

Selecting colors as the basis for palettes depends on a variety on a variety of factors

-   Use of **town, regional, or county colours** may work well for local or regional campaigns
-   Colours may also associated with a certain **movement** (e.g. green for environmental issues, pink/purple for feminist movements, etc)
-   Something that works based on **tone** - dark colours may not work in a campaign for children’s park, but light pastels may work better

Color theory is well researched, and there are a variety of resources online describing this. (https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory)
