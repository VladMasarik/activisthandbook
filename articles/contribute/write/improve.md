**In this guide, you will learn how to improve existing content on Activist Handbook. You will talk about integrating external resources, making use of search engine research (SEO) and translation.**

Activist Handbook has something unique: our articles are never finished. Just like Wikipedia, our articles are written by many people. Everyone can make a big or small contribution. In this guide, you will learn how you can help make Activist Handbook better.

## The ‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô section

We actively encourage everyone to start editing Activist Handbook. We do this on every page, in the _‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô_ section. You can find this somewhere at the bottom of the page.

In this section, we give concrete suggestions on how you can make that specific page better. If you have suggestions on how a page can be made better but do not have the time or knowledge to do it yourself, we encourage you to add your suggestions to the _‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô_ section.

Every page has different needs. Sometimes it needs to be restructured. Sometimes the language used is too difficult. Just browse around and see if there is any way for you to help!

## Do I need permission to edit?

**No, Activist Handbook is as much yours as anyone else's!** You are allowed to edit our pages, without asking anyone for permission. However, there is a one thing to keep in mind:

**If you want to make big changes, first suggest these changes to others. Examples of big changes are:**

-   Moving articles to a new location
    
-   Deleting content
    
-   Creating a new page
    
-   Completely restructuring an article (Only if it already contains a lot of content. If it is still empty, you do not need to talk with others first.)
    

**You can suggest your changes to others by adding them in the _‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô_ section.**

## Do not go for perfect

It is easy to get stuck spending a lot of time working on your improvements and trying to deliver perfect work. This is not the right approach.

We have the following recommendations:

-   **‚úÖ Do** add the results of your work to Activist Handbook straight away.
    
-   **‚úÖ Do** make small improvements over time.
    
-   **‚ùå Do not** spend days doing research without updating Activist Handbook.
    
-   **‚ùå Do not** try to deliver perfect all at once.
    

If you take on too much by yourself all at once, you will likely give up halfway and not publish anything anything at all. It is better to work in small steps and share updates frequently. This also makes it easier for others to see what you are working on and build upon your work.

## Find out what people look up

We use [search engine research (SEO)](/tools/seo) to write better content for Activist Handbook. That might sound complex, but in this section, we explain in easy words how you can make use of this too.

In every ‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô section, we also list some search queries that are related to that guide. For each, we say how many people look up that search query per month. We use this information to determine what challenges activists face most and what words they use to find solutions.

-   **‚úÖ Do** improve and add new content about popular search queries.
    
-   ‚úÖ **Do** slightly rephrase titles to match the terminology used by activists.
    
-   **‚ùå Do not** randomly try to put as many popular keywords in a guide.
