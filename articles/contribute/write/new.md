Do you have an idea for a guide? In this article you will learn how to write a guide for Activist Handbook.

## 1\. Formulate your question

All our guides answer a question that starts with: **"How to..."**

For example:

-   How to organise a protest?
    
-   How to keep people involved?
    
-   How to reach more people using social media?
    

Keep in mind **your audience**: _activists all over the globe, fighting for various causes_

## 2\. Check existing content

Before you create a new guide, have a look on Activist Handbook to see if similar content already exists! We encourage you to make existing guides better.

-   Use the search bar
    
-   Check out the relevant chapters
    
-   Ask our moderators for help: [contact@activisthandbook.org](mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org)
    

Does something similar exist already? Check out our guide on [how to improve existing content](/contribute/write/improve).

## 3\. Find the right location

Once you are sure no similar content exists, it is time to find the right location to publish your new content.

1.  **Find out what chapter is most relevant**: add it in that chapter.
    
2.  **Check if related articles already exist**: add it as sub-article.
    

There is a lot of content on Activist Handbook, so it might be hard for you to find the right location. To get help, pitch your idea to our moderators!
