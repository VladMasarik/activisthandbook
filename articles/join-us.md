**Activist Handbook is the Wikipedia for activists, and you can help us build it.**

We are writing a digital handbook for activists. Anyone can contribute, you too. We need artists, lawyers, doctors, students and everyone else wants to make this world a better place.

## We need to act now

These are frighting times. We are heading for a climate catastrophe. Yet, our political leaders continue to fund the fossil industry with millions of dollars. But we can still fix this. If we start organising, mobilising and let our voices be heard, we can shift the tide.

We are a Activist Handbook. We educate and train those who are brave enough to challenge the status quo. We believe thereâ€™s no one who can stop us, once we unite and act as one.

## Our plan

In short, this is what we are doing:

1.  Bring together change-makers from all over the world.
2.  Enable them to exchange experiences using our online platform.
3.  Translate and localise all content to make it available for everyone.

## How you can contribute

Activist Handbook is built by people like you. This is how you can contribute:

-   Collect resources about activism (for example: books, movies, podcasts, articles)
-   Share your experiences as an activist.
-   If you are bilingual, translate a page.

-   Design illustrations for our articles.

## About us

Activist Handbook was originally created by six activists from various countries in Europe during the FYEG Summercamp Hackathon 2019 in Serbia. We wanted to create a guidebook for fellow activists that would empower them to fight for change. Now, we have a team of coordinators and members from all over the world.
