Activist Handbook is a Wikipedia-like platform for people to exchange experiences about change-making. We are training activists who are not afraid to challenge the status quo. Join us today:

## We meet online & in local hubs

We're activists from all over the world, so we cannot regularly meet face to face. Instead, we regularly have video calls. Are you new with Activist Handbook? We would very much like to get to know you during our next call! We also have an open [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/activisthandbook/) in which activists can exchange experiences. Lastly, we communicate using a Slack workplace. If you would like to join our Slack, make sure to fill in the form above

Our community exists out of over 100 people from 20+ different countries (check out our [members map](/map)). More than 450 people have joined our Facebook group. Learn more about our team on the [about page](/about).

## We value diversity

We believe that diversity strengthens our organisation. That is why we encourage people of all genders, sexual preferences and ethnic backgrounds, including people with disabilities, to join our cause.
