**Humanity is not on the right track. We are destroying our planet. Democratic and human rights are being threatened. And the rich are fuelling the fire. It's time to act.**

## **Why 350 million?**

Science shows that change happens when 3.5% of the population takes action. In 2050, there will be 10 billion people on this planet. That's why we are going to train 350 million activists.

Right now, we train 4000 new activists every month.
