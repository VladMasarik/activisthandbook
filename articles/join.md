**Humanity is not on the right track. We are destroying our planet. Our democratic and human rights are being threatened. And the super-rich are fueling the fire. So let's learn how to do something about that. Join our campaign and help us train 350 million activists.**

## **Why 350 million?**

Science shows that change happens when 3.5% of the population takes action. In 2050, there will be 10 billion people on this planet. That's why we are going to train 350 million activists. 

Right now, we train 4000 new activists every month.

## **How can I help?**

Everyone can contribute. We are curious to hear what skills you would like to bring to our team. And we encourage learning new skills:

-   📝 Write or translate articles
    
-   📢 Help with promotion and outreach
    
-   📆 Organise events
    
-   🎬 Record or edit videos
    
-   🎨 Design illustrations
    
-   💻 Develop open source web apps
    
-   🤑 Find funds or manage our finances
    

You do not need to be an experienced activist. We will help you get started and give you training:

## **What happens after I join?**

After you sign up:

1.  First, we will **schedule a video call** with you to get to know each other.
    
2.  We will share our **guides for volunteers** to help you get started.
    

Then you **get together 5 to 10 people** to kickstart your local campaign.
