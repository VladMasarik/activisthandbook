**In this chapter, you will learn how to transform a group of individuals into a powerful movement. We will talk about how you can build capacity to make impact, how to facilitate a welcoming atmosphere for everyone, and how to set up an organisational structure for decision making.**

## Start organising

You want to achieve change. But where do you start? We recommend you find likeminded people and start organising yourselves together. No matter whether you just decided to take action, or would like to improve the organisational structure of an existing movement, these three guides should help you get started:

1.  ‚úä [**Organise a protest**](/organising/protest) ‚Äî Take action today
    
2.  üì¢ [**Organise a campaign**](/organising/campaign) - Make plans for the upcoming year
    
3.  **üåä** [**Build a movement**](/organising/build-movement) ‚Äî In it for the long run
    
4.  **üìÑ** [**Organisation frameworks**](/organising/frameworks) ‚Äî Organise better
