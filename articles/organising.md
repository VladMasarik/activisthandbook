**In this chapter, we explain how to get started with grassroots organizing. Our toolkit explains how to build a movement by looking at successful examples.**

## Start organising

To build an impactful grassroots movement, start small. Organise a protest action that helps you to grow your group. Next, plan a campaign: a series of actions to pressure decision makers. Then scale up by building a decentralised movement. Finally, improve your teamwork by learning from other movements.

## Q&A

### **What is grassroots organising?**

Grassroots organizing is a way of working with communities to create change from the ground up.
