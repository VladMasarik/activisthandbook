## **Privacy in Archiving - Protecting the safety of people**

There are two different aspects of privacy to take into account - the privacy of people who are users of the archive and those whose stories are parts of collections. There are often also legal requirements to protect the privacy of information (precise laws vary from country to country). It is best practice to ask for consent from any living people whose information is a part of an archival collection, before providing researchers and other stakeholders with access to these collections.
