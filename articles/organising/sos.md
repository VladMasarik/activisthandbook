**The Self-Organising System (SOS) is an organising system used by Extinction Rebellion, based on** [**Holacracy**](/organising/holacracy)**. It helps movements organise, communicate and make decisions.**

The SOS allows to proactively structure how to organise, allowing to reflect on your values and leave behind ways of working that reproduce injustices and emotional pain in society. The SOS is a tool for to decentralise and scale; form leaderful groups and mitigate for power.

## How to contribute

This article currently focusses on how Extinction Rebellion uses SOS. However, it seems like there is a lot of potential for other movements to adapt similar organisational structures.

**You can make this article better** by investigating the differences between Holacracy & SOS. Analyse whether this adaptation of Holacracy is more suitable for an activist context and working primarily with volunteers.
