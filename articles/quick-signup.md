**Activist Handbook is like the Wikipedia for activists, and you can help us build it. Join our movement by signing up below!**

We are writing a digital handbook for activists. But it is not just any handbook. Anyone can contribute, you too! Saw an interesting article or documentary? Add it. Are you bilingual? Help us by translating one of our articles.

We need artists, lawyers, doctors, students and everyone else wants to make this world a better place. No matter if you have experience with activism or not, you can join us!

We are a Activist Handbook. We educate those who are brave enough to challenge the status quo. We believe thereâ€™s no one who can stop us, once we unite and act as one. _Sign up, and our international community of change-makers today:_
