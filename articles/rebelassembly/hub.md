## Q&A

### What is this event about?

During the [International Rebel Assembly](/rebelassembly), activists from around the globe will be getting together in small local hubs to write guides for change-makers.

The event is an intense, sprint-like team work activity that lasts for only 2 days, and produces clear written outputs. All your work will be added to Activist Handbook, the Wikipedia for rebels.

### What is a rebel hub?

A rebel hub is a small self organised group of change-makers who share the same geographical region. Hubs get together online or in real life during the International Rebel Assembly.

You can start your own hub and invite fellow activists. Both individuals and existing organisations can host a rebel hub. Rebel hubs are set up by two or more hub coordinators. Although we expect the hub coordinators to be proficient in English, speaking English is not a requirement for other hub participants.

### **Who can apply as hub coordinator?**

We invite all green, social and progressive activists who live in the following timezones to apply: UTC-1 to UTC+4 (Africa, East & West Europe, Middle East).

### **What will the program look like?**

In the months before the event, hub coordinations will receive extensive training from the international prep team. In collaboration with the prep team, the hub coordinators will be choosing themes to write about.

During the event, the participants will brainstorm about the exact topics they want to write about, within the beforehand selected themes. There will be icebreakers and community building sessions. And most importantly: the participants will be writing guides for activists.

The hub coordinators will facilitate this programme, with the help of the prep team.

### What will we be writing about?

We will write guides for activists. The hub coordinators and the prep team will decide together what themes each hub will write about. The participants will write about topics within those themes.

For example, one hub could write about the wellbeing of activists. And another one could write about promotion and outreach. Hub coordinators will be able to choose themes that are relevant to their movements and local contexts.
