## Improve this page

Feel free to add resources about activism on this page. Please make sure the resource follows the following guidelines:

-   **The resource is about activism in general**. If there is a page on this website that is more related, add it on that page. For example, a resource on how to organise a protest march fits better on the page about [protest marches](/tactics/march). This way it becomes easier to find the right resources. If you are unsure where to place a resource, add it to the comments!
-   **Resources in other languages should be added to the resource pages of those languages, unless there are translations or subtitles available.** If no resources page exists for your language yet, you can create it yourself.
-   **Summarise what the resource is about.** Add (if applicable) the author, the year of publication, and a brief summary of the contents of the resource.
-   **Whenever possible, link to the website of the original author, instead of websites like Amazon.** We are not here to help these monopolists get better search engine results.
