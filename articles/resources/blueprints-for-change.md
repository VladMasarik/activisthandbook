**Blueprints for Change is a collection of high-quality guides for activists. They provide practical ‘how to’ guides for social change-makers, to help movements organise and plan more effectively. Their guides are a valuable asset for campaigners. In our resources chapter, you can find similar** [**websites for protestors**](/resources/websites)**.**

> In 2022, [Blueprints for Change](https://blueprintsfc.org/guides/) recently decided to stop producing new articles due to little capacity. Instead, they have now shifted to being an international network for campaigners.
> 
> Since all their guides were published under a Creative Commons licence, Activist Handbook will integrate all their materials with this website. We've already integrated the following articles:
> 
> -   [Movement coalition building](/organising/coalition-building)
> -   [Digital security for activists](/tools/security)
> -   [A/B testing your message](/communication/a-b-testing)
> -   [Using chat apps for campaigning](/communication/chat-apps)
> -   [Phone banking for activist movements](/communication/phone-banking)
> -   [Facebook Groups for activists](/tools/facebook-groups)

## **Difference Blueprints for Change and Activist Handbook**

Guides published by Blueprints for Change are written by a group of experienced campaigners, and are always peer-reviewed. This means that their resources usually provide very detailed and qualitative insights into activist tactics. Activist Handbook, on the other hand, takes a more Wikipedia-style approach, making it more accessible for a large number of people to contribute. This results in a wider range of topics that are covered.

Another difference is the platform used to publish content. Blueprints for Change uses Google Docs, which are harder to find using search engines. At Activist Handbook, we use specialised wiki software, specifically developed for collaborative knowledge exchange.

## A reusable resource

Blueprints for Change has published all their articles for activists under a Creative Commons licence, just like Activist Handbook. This means that change-makers can redistribute and make adaptations to their work, which we think is awesome!

Thanks to this approach, we were able to publish their resources on Activist Handbook as well.

### **How important is this page?**

The website of Seeds for Change receives about 17 monthly visits through organic search traffic, of which most from the US. The website has 258 backlinks.

Since Blueprints for Change currently does not have the capacity to produce any new guides, we think it is best to integrate all their content with Activist Handbook.
