[**Community Tool Box**](https://ctb.ku.edu/en) **is a large collection of guides for people who want to make a difference in their local communities.**

Why this resource is great:

-   Very extensive
-   Well organised
-   Based on academic research
-   All licensed under Creative commons!

Why this resource is not so great:

-   Focussed on local communities, but overlooks bigger systemic issues. Almost all strategies proposed focus on making a difference locally. While this is great for people who want to make a direct impact, it doesn't bring us closer to something like radically overhauling our toxic capitalist society.
-   Focus on US context
