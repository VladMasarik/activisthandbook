**In this article, we discuss the book “Glossary of Civil Resistance: A Resource for Study and Translation of Key Terms” by Hardy Merriman and Nicola Barrach-Yousefi (2021).**

The field of civil resistance is dedicated to understanding how people can fight for rights, freedom, and justice, without the use of violence. This glossary provides definitions and expansive commentary on civil resistance terminology to support sharing of lessons learned and research across different languages.

Hardy Merriman and Nicola Barrach-Yousefi’s new glossary is intended to support the translation of materials, but non-translators will also find value in it, as a great deal can be learned about the concepts in the field that underlie each term.
