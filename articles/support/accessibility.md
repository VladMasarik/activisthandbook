**We want everyone to be able to contribute as a volunteer to Activist Handbook. We created this page to help you participate. If there is something we can do to become more inclusive, do let us know.**

## Timezone differences

We are an international organisation, so all of us live in different timezones. Here is what we do to make our events and meetings as inclusive as possible:

-   We try to organise our meetings at times that work for as many people as possible (usually at 14:00 UTC, which is the evening in Asia, morning in America and late afternoon in Europe). If an event is at an inconvenient time for you, do let us know!
-   We record all our meetings so people can watch them back later.
-   We are setting up rebel hubs, so you can physically meet up with volunteers of Activist Handbook in a location near you (also reducing travel costs).
