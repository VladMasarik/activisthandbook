On this page you will learn how to add links to articles. There are two ways to add links: by typing in the link **manually**, or by using the **Insert Link to Page** button. If you are inexperienced, we recommend using the Insert Page function.

In addition, you will learn how to save a permanent copy of an external webpage by archiving it.

## Manually

1.  Make sure you are [logged in](/support/log-in-or-register).
2.  Start [editing](/support/edit-create-move-or-delete-a-page) a page.
3.  **Select some text** and click the **Link** icon in the formatting bar or press **ctrl+K** (Mac: **cmd+K**)

## Insert Link to Page

1.  Make sure you are [logged in](/support/log-in-or-register).
2.  Start [editing](/support/edit-create-move-or-delete-a-page) a page.
3.  **Select some text** and click the **Insert Link to Page** icon (right next to the Link icon).
4.  A dialog will open in which you can select a page. On the left side, you can see all folders. On the left side you can see the pages in the folder that you have selected. **Select a page** and click the blue **Select** button in the bottom right of the dialog. The correct link has now automatically been added.

## Save a permanent copy using archive.org

Often, we link to external resources. However, web pages might be deleted or the URL changes. To make sure the resource stays available forever, we use a tool provided by archive.org.

To save a permanent copy of a webpage, go to [**web.archive.org/save**](https://web.archive.org/save). Then **fill in the URL** of the website you want to save and click **Save page**.

Copy the link to the saved webpage and add it to a resource like this:

-   Title of webpage by Author Name (2020) \[[Archived version](https://web.archive.org/)\]

Or like this when referenced in-text:

_Lorem ipsum, blah, blah, as explained_ [_here_](/support/adding-links/#) _\[_[_Archived version_](https://web.archive.org/)_\]_
