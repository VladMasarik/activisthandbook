> We are here to help you out! Reach out to us if you need support: [contact@activisthandbook.org](mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org)

## Change the website language

To change the **Language**, click the button with the globe icon in the top right. Then select your language.

**The page might not be translated yet in your language.** If this is the case, you will see a screen saying the page does not exist. There is also a button to create the page. Feel free to create an account and add a translation to the page!

## Adding translations

To translate a specific page into your language, first open the page that you want to translate. Then change the page language (explained above). If the page already exists in your language, you can now click the edit button. If the page does not exist, feel free to create it yourself!
