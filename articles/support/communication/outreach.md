## Script video call partners

There is a [**partnership script**](https://forms.gle/CzJoF95HhpppNG5J8) that you can follow during a video call with potential partners. Simply follow the instructions in the form and fill in any answers that the representative of the organisation may give. A call takes about 15 to 30 minutes. You should also reseverve some time (5/10 mins) after the video call to send a follow-up message.

> **Important:**
> 
> -   It is recommended to go through the form and practice with someone else before using it with one of our potential partners.
> -   The script is written for conversations with people/organisations you do not know very well yet. If someone is a close friend, or it is an organisation that we've been working with for a long time, you might want to consider deviating from the script.

The scripts consists of the following elements:

1.  **‚òéÔ∏è Before the call:** Preparing the conversation.
2.  **üëã Introduction:** Getting to know each other
3.  üåä **Learning about their movement:** Showing interest, finding out what kind of organisation they are.
4.  **üôå Present Activist Handbook partnerships:** Introducing our project, explaining how we can work together.
5.  ‚ù§Ô∏è **Working together:** Discussing concrete ways we can collaborate.
6.  **‚≠ïÔ∏è Rounding off:** Leaving them with a good feeling, taking a picture for our socials.

## Follow up

Your conversation with (potential) partners does not end after the first video call.

### **üí¨ Message after the video call.**

We recommend you to send a follow up message immediately after the video call with a recap of everything you discussed. Even if you make notes, you might forget to This message should contain concrete next steps that the two of you will take.

If they agreed to promote Activist Handbook on their **social media**, this is a template message you can share with them:

> We're excited to announce that we're starting a collaboration with Activist Handbook, the Wikipedia for rebels! Check out their platform:  
> üëâ [https://activisthandbook.org/](/)

And here's a template message for their website:

> We are a proud partner of [**Activist Handbook**](/), the Wikipedia for rebels. Check out their platform to learn more about [organising](/organising) protests, [growing](/communication) your movement, taking care of the [wellbeing](/wellbeing) of your fellow activists, and much more!
> 
> Activist Handbook is an international project, developed to make it easier for change-makers all over the globe exchange knowledge. The platform is free and open source.

### **‚òëÔ∏è Reminder message for next steps.**

If you agreed during the video call that the other person would take some kind of action, but it is taking a long time for them to do so, you should send them a friendly reminder.

### **‚òéÔ∏è Yearly check-in video call.**

We recommend you to check in with all our partners at least once a year .
