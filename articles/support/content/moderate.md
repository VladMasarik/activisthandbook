Moderators uphold quality by proofreading, adding references and fixing vandalism. You can help!

> Quick actions:
> 
> -   [**Report vandalism**](http://activism.rocks/vandalism)**:** Help us respond quickly to vandalism. Report it and we'll fix it ASAP.
> -   [**Request a review**](http://activism.rocks/review)**:** Wrote something yourself and want someone to read it over? We're happy to help you out.

Here's how you can start moderating:

1.  [**Sign up**](http://activism.rocks/join) **and join our Slack.**
2.  You'll now receive an invite link to join our Slack workspace. Join the channel #moderation.
3.  Every time someone edits the website, requests a review or reports vandalism, it will be reported in that channel. In some cases, you may need to [request the necessary permissions](mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org) before you can edit our website.

## Transparency

In principle, we allow anyone to contribute to our shared knowledge base on activism. However, everyone who wishes to do so, must follow [our principles](/about/principles).

Any changes made are saved forever. We do this to provide transparency about who has contributed to Activist Handbook.
