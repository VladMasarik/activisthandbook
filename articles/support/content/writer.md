**In this guide, we will help you to get started as a writer. If you have not written about activism before, we are here to help you. We meet weekly to check-in with each other.**

## Writing workflow

> If you just want to share a resource, fill in [this form](https://airtable.com/shriE1ATGx41eaL5I).

1.  [**Submit the topic idea**](https://airtable.com/shr8oOvaeHOtBOK5t) **via our form.** The content coordinator will review your topic idea before the upcoming meeting
2.  **Join the first upcoming writers meeting** to hear feedback and develop your topic idea. If you want, we can match you with a writer buddy.
3.  **Meet weekly in one of two time slots** with the coordinator and other writers to check in, and either:
    -   **Work independently with your buddy**
    -   **Get support from content coordinator**
4.  **When you finish your article, submit it for** [**peer review**](https://airtable.com/shrn25XgXKGWkuKKI). One of our other writers will read your article and give feedback.
5.  **Publish the article on the website and send a** [**social media request**](http://activism.rocks/request-post) **for promotion.** If you need help publishing the article on our website, contact our tech coordinator.
