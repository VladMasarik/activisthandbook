To help you get started, we have created a [template document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gM7-SrBhkLfZoHa5vZkxqBgTXh07G9ByAY7JVbdNuxQ/edit?usp=sharing) for the meeting agenda and minutes.

> Note: this guide is specifically intended for the coordination team of Activist Handbook. We do not have a guide intended to be read by a broader audience yet.
