**On this page we provide an overview of all the digital tools that our coordination team uses.**

> **Training & support:** Getting to know all of the tools that we use can be a bit overwhelming. That is why we like to schedule a video call so we can show you step by step how to use these tools. Don't hesitate to ask for help!

## List of tools

### Slack

Our most important platform to communicate is Slack. As a coordinator, you will be added to the closed channel #team-coordinators. You will be able to see all messages that coordinators have sent before.

### Google Workspace

The easiest way to get started with our Google Workspace is to [add our account to your Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en). To receive the login details for our account, reach out to one of your fellow coordinators. We use two-step verification, so another member will always have to verify your login (a password alone is not enough).

> **🔐 IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING:** Please, do not save passwords of your personal accounts while logged in with the Activist Handbook account. That means that all of us could see your private login details!
> 
> You are personally responsible for keeping your private data safe. Take that responsibility serious.

We use our paid Google Workspace plan for the following tools:

-   **Google Calendar:** We save all our events and team meetings in our shared calendar. A weekly overview of all events is automatically be sent in Slack.
-   **Google Contacts:** Anyone who has previously communicated with us via email or signed up via Mailchimp is automatically added to our contact list.
-   **Gmail:** Our emails address contact@activisthandbook.org is managed using gmail.
-   **Chrome bookmarks:** To help you find frequently used tools, we have added some useful links to our Chrome toolbar.
-   **Password manager:** All our account credentials are saved in our digital keychain.
-   **Google Meet:** For our video calls, we use Google Meet.

### Pitch

We use Pitch to create beautiful slide presentations. For example, our we use Pitch for our bi-weekly updates. You need to be added to our Pitch workspace before you can use it!

### Mailchimp

We use Mailchimp for our newsletter, signup pages and automated replies. This tool is especially useful for our communications coordinator.

### Hootsuite

We use Hootsuite to manage all our social media accounts more efficiently. This tool is especially useful for our communications coordinator.

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to track which pages on our website are most frequently visited and how people find us.

### Microsoft Flow

Various tools that we use are connected with each other using Microsoft Flow.
