## Edit a page

Anyone can edit pages on Activist Handbook. All edits are saved. This makes it easier for moderators to prevent vandalism and creates transparency about who added what information.

To edit a page, click the blue **Edit** button in the bottom right corner. Our visual editor will now appear. Use the menu bar on the top of the screen to style the text. We also have a more elaborate guide on [how to style and format articles](@) on Activist Handbook. Once you are done editing, make sure to click the green **Save** button in the top right. To close the visual editor, click the red **Close** button in the top right.

### Solving & preventing a save conflict

When multiple people are editing the same page simultaneously, the visual editor will will give an orange warning in the top right. A problem might arise once one of the people saves their edits, after which another person saves their own edits, causing the first person's edits to be overwritten.

Luckily, all edits are saved in the [**version history**](#). When you notice your edits are being overwritten, just copy your contributions from the version history and save the page again.

To prevent a save conflict, **save your edits regularly** while typing.

## Create a new page

Anyone can create new pages. However, to prevent moderators will delete the page, make sure to make clear what the page is about. Add some resources and related topics. Also ensure that the page does not get 'abandoned' (when no other page links towards it).

To create a **new page**, click the button in the top right corner with the icon of a document and a plus sign. First, you will have to fill in a **path** where the new page will be stored. Use '/' to add the document inside a folder. Then click the **Select** button. A dialoge will appear asking what editor you would like to use. Select the **Visual editor**. Another dialoge will appear asking you to fill **page properties** such as the page name, description and tags. Once you are done filling in the page properties, click the **Ok** button. You can now start editing. Make sure to click the **Create** button once you are done editing.

## Move a page

Pages on Activist Handbook are organised in folders. They can only exist in one place at the same time. However, it is possible to create a redirect link.

Here is how to change the page url or put the page in a different folder: First, open the page you would like to move. Then click the blue **Edit** button in the bottom right corner. On the top right, click the **Page** button with the blue label icon. This will open up a window where you can change various page properties.

To edit the page url, change the **Path** field. Remember: paths should not contain any special characters such as "!@#%" or spaces. Alternatively, you can also click the **Folder** button with the looking glass, to browse and select a folder. Do not forget to close the window by clicking **Ok** and then the **Save** button with the green checkmark in the top right corner.

## Delete a page

> You need to be a **moderator** or **administrator** in order to be able to delete a page. If you accidentally created a page which should be deleted, send us a message: [contact@activisthandbook.org](mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org)

Deleting a page is currently only possible on desktops. To delete a page, hover over the **Edit** button in the bottom right corner with your mouse. Then click the red delete button with the **trash icon**. Verify your action by clicking the **Delete** button.
