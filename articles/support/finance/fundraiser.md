## The idea of funding

Traditionally this means looking for financing opportunities. In most cases fundraisers look for calls for proposals, help write budgets for projects, organize crowdfunding campaigns, ask for donations etc.

In Activist Handbook “funding” goes beyond just looking for money. There are multitude of ways of getting second hand equipment which has monetary value, accepting people's work as a form of unpaid gift with a monetary value, finding opensource and free-access spaces, software etc that would have monetary value if they were on a market.
