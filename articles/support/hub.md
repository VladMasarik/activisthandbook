## Q&A

### What is a Rebel Hub?

A Rebel Hub is a local community of activists and rebel trainers. They are part of our international network of Rebel Hubs.

A Rebel Hub trains change-makers and collects the knowledge and experiences of activists in their city or country. Because activism is different in every country, we are writing guides about activism in different local contexts. They support existing movements and help organise campaigns.

You can start your own hub and invite fellow activists. Both individuals and existing organisations can host a rebel hub. Rebel hubs are set up by two or more hub coordinators. Although we expect the hub coordinators to be proficient in English, speaking English is not a requirement for other hub members.

With our train-the-trainer programme, you will learn how to train activists from experienced campaigners around the globe.

You can start a Rebel Hub with a small group of people. We recommend to start with 2 coordinators.

### What are my responsibilities?

As a hub coordinator, you organise a local hub, help with the preparations leading up to the rebel assembly, and host your hub during the event. A rebel hub is a network of local activists, movements and changemakers. With the support of Activist Handbook, you expand your network of changemakers in your region. You prepare and motivate your fellow hub members, organise an accessible (physical or online) location and function as the main contact person between your hub and Activist Handbook. During the event, you keep track of your hub's needs and make sure everyone can participate.

### **Why rebel hubs?**

During the International Rebel Assembly changemakers from across the world come together online and offline to make practical guides for rebels. Organising in these local hubs makes the event accessible, effective and fun. It allows you to meet fellow changemakers in your region, work on and learn about the topics relevant to your shared context and write in the language you are most comfortable with.

### **How does a rebel hub work?**

Rebel hubs consist of one or two hub coordinators who are responsible for initiating and facilitating the hub. A hub can be any size and can be organised in a way that suits the hub members. The rebel hub coordinators will be the key contact person between Activist Handbook and their hub. The hub can join and contribute in a language of your choosing and no previous experience is required. The event will start off with a program of training that meets the needs of hubs and allow participants to exchange knowledge and skills. To ensure everyone can feel welcome to join we ask you to follow [Activist Handbook’s principles](/about/principles).

### **What does a rebel hub do?**

Leading up to the rebel assembly, hubs will play an active role in the preparations necessary to organise their hub. In addition, rebel hubs are invited to give their input on the program and training they’d like the event to include. Physical hubs will organise an accessible location to host the event. Online hubs will get familiar with how they can use online tools to build a sense of community and work in an inclusive and effective way. Before the event begins you will discuss with your fellow hub members what topic(s) you want to work on. Depending on your skills and interests you can choose to write or translate articles, create illustrations or contribute in another way.

## **In real life and online hubs**

The international rebel assembly is a decentralised, hybrid event. Instead of gathering in one central location, the event takes place in a variety of locations. This allows for a diverse group of people to meet and work together in an accessible way. As a rebel hub, you have a lot of freedom in how you organise your hub. The program will be a combination of online and offline activities that are customisable to the situation of your hub.

## **Support for online hubs**

If you prefer meeting in an online hub we will match people on the basis of (lingual) region and/or shared interests. Activist Handbook will support these online hubs with the online facilitation and tools where needed since most of their program will take place online.

-   Guides for online tools

## **Support for physical hubs**

For physical hubs, there will be a focus on offline facilitation. As a physical hub, you can choose to what extent your hub will follow the online program, and how much you will self-organise by yourself. This might depend on your hub's access to devices and a stable internet connection.

The decentralised and hybrid character makes the event more flexible with the still unpredictable Corona pandemic. We want to organise an event that is as safe and accessible as possible for all participants. That is why the taken covid measurements will depend on the situation of the hubs and the hub coordinators' preference.
