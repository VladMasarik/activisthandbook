**In this guide, we will help you to get started as a localisation coordinator. If you are already a localisation coordinator, we encourage you to edit this guide to make it fit better with your working style. This will help both you and your successor! Also make sure to check out the** [**other guides for coordinators**](/support/core)

## Localisation coordinator

**Summary:** As localisation coordinator, your domain is the facilitation of the localisation circle. You need to understand how the circle roles interact with each other and work with the members of the circle and translation sub-circle in order to improve the flow. You are also a representative of the **Core circle** and are responsible to make sure the purpose of Activist Handbook is known within the localisation circle. You will facilitate the circle meetings and set up strategies on how to develop the localisation of Activist Handbook.

**Role definition:** You can find the exact purpose, domain and accountabilities of this role in [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shr6GqOJ7587fNbEn/tbloV4g8loVisebVz/viwcTSIOwzDuE9XBn/recEvF60ALJ8P35UT).

**As a coordinator, you should understand Holacracy and all of its components in order to be able to facilitate cross-circle cooperation.**
