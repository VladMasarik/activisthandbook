## Translate an article

Anyone can edit articles and add translations to our website. Follow these steps:

1.  [Log in](/login) or [create a new account](/register).
2.  Learn [how to translate a page](/support/change-language-and-add-translations).
3.  Once you have translated (part of) a page, make sure to [submit it for review](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNa1Tr5QDPgPYEuu-UtXkWvdVqNBoic5EU_aSy558gBvhQeQ/viewform). One of our members will read your translation and give feedback.

## Help us translate WikiJS

Our website was built using WikiJS, which is currently available in over 40 languages. You can help by translating user interface items (buttons, settings pages, etc.) More than 250 people have already helped to translate WikiJS!

1.  Use this [invite link](https://lokalise.com/public/2994254859f751ea605a00.03473540/) to select the language you want to translate. If you do not yet have a Localise account, make sure to create one.
2.  Once you are logged in open the WikiJS project in the [Localise dashboard](https://app.lokalise.com).
3.  You will now see a list of words and phrases that still need to be translated, or need verification. It may seem a bit overwhelming at first, so make sure to check out the guide on [how to use the Localise editor](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2089277-the-editor-functions).
