You will work closely together with language and regional representatives to support and engage people that want to localise the content of Activist Handbook. You will also be responsible for developing a localisation workflow that suits the capacity and needs of the translators.

## Improving this article

This page is still very empty. Improve it by filling it with content. If you have ideas on how to improve this article, but do not have time to do it right now, add some suggestions below:

-   What is the translation sub-circle?
-   Article on localisation workflows and tools.
-   Explain the difference between localisation and translation, the relevance in activism and how we use both terms within the localisation circle.
    -   [Translation and localization: whatâ€™s the difference?](https://lokalise.com/blog/translation-and-localization-difference/) Lokalise (2021)
-   How to support and engage peer translators online.
-   How to enable translators to translate youtube content (subtitles, titles and descriptions) of Activist Handbook
    -   Because Activist Handbook has a brand account, we are not able to enable solely permission as Subtitle Editor ([only possible an non-brand accounts](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11983512?hl=en&ref_topic=7296214#zippy=%2Cgive-access-to-subtitle-editor-role-as-a-channel-owner-or-manager)).
    -   Here is [more info on brand account](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9367690#channelpermissions) (features, roles and permissions). It appears translators need to have the manager role to create and edit subtitles (which enables them to do a lot more with the channel as well).
