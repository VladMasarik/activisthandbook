Anyone can create an Activist Handbook account. You need an account to edit pages or to place comments.

On this page we explain how to register and how to log in. You will also find information on what to do if you forgot your password, or if you think someone else might have access to your account.

> We are here to help you out! Reach out to us if you need support: [contact@activisthandbook.org](mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org)

## Register

You can create an account by going to the [**registration page**](/register). Fill in your **email**, **password** (twice) and **name**. Then click **Register**.

## Login

You need an account to log in. If you do not yet have an account yet, register first.

To log in, click the **Account** button in the top right with the icon of a person. If you are not logged in yet, you will be sent to the login page. Fill in your **email** and **password**. Then click the **Login** button.

## Change my password

If you think someone else might have access to your account, you should change your password immediately. Log in and go to your [**Profile page**](/p/profile). You can change your password in the **Authentication** box. Fill in your **current password** and your **new password** (twice). Then click **Save password**.

## I forgot my password

If you forgot your password, you can reset it. Go to the [**login**](/login) page first. Then click **Forgot your password**. Fill in your **email** and click **Reset password**. You will now receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password.
