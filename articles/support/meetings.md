**In this guide, we explain when and how we meet. We highly recommend volunteers to subscribe to** [**our Google Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y29udGFjdEBhY3RpdmlzdGhhbmRib29rLm9yZw)**.**

## Schedule

We follow a 4-week schedule, as outlined below. We encourage all volunteers to join our _General_ and _Governance_ meetings.

Circles other than the core circle may schedule their own meetings as well. Check the relevant Slack channels for the dates of those meetings.

<div><table><thead><tr><th>Weeks</th><th>Meeting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Week 1</td><td>General meeting</td></tr><tr><td>Week 2</td><td>Core circle meeting</td></tr><tr><td>Week 3</td><td>Governance meeting</td></tr><tr><td>Week 4</td><td>Core circle meeting</td></tr><tr><td><i>After week 4, repeat.</i></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

## Virtual workspace

When you are working on Activist Handbook, you can join a [huddle on Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/4402059015315-Start-a-huddle-in-a-channel-or-direct-message), to show that you are available for others. This way, we simulate a virtual 'workspaceâ€™.

## Meeting formats

Our meetings always follow a structured format. There are two formats that we use:

-   **Tactical:** General and circle meetings follow the [tactical format](https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings) of Holacracy.
-   **Governance:** Governance meetings follow the [governance format](https://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings) of Holacracy.
