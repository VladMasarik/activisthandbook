## Creating headings

To organise text in headings, use the button all the way to the left of the menu bar saying 'Paragraph'. Large headings have small numbers, small headings have large numbers. Always start with Heading 1 and use Heading 2 to create subheadings, Heading 3 to create sub-subheadings, and so forth.

## Adding a quote block

To create a quote block, use the button with the quotation mark icon: **"**

> This is a quote block!

## Adding an image

To add an image, click the button with the landscape icon, which looks something like this: ðŸ–¼
