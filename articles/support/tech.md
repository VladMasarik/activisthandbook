## **About this circle**

**Summary:** Tech circle is in charge of smooth functioning of our website, choices of apps we use in our day-to-day communication, technical support for our users and development of the project [Rebel Tools](https://rebel.tools/).

We use open source code and our long term goal is to assemble a group of dedicated hacker-activists who will work on development of free and secure online apps for activists all over the world. We're constantly improving Activist Handbook's functionalities and working hard on training our members in web development.
