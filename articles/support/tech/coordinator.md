## **Your role**

**Summary:** Representation of the [Tech circle](/support/tech) in the [Core circle](/support/core), so that organisation-wide decisions can be made. As Tech coordinator, your domain is the facilitation of the Tech circle. You need to understand how the circle roles interact with each other and work with their representatives in order to improve the flow.

You are also a representative of the [Core circle](/support/core) and are responsible to make sure the purpose of Activist Handbook is known within the [Tech circle](/support/tech). You have access to tools and communication channels of the Core circle. You will occasionally facilitate the circle meetings and set up strategies on how to develop further the website of Activist Handbook and the [Rebel Tools](https://rebel.tools/) project.
