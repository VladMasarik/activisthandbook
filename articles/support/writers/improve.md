**In this guide, you will learn how to improve existing content on Activist Handbook. You will talk about integrating external resources, making use of search engine research (SEO) and translation.**

Activist Handbook has something unique: our articles are never finished. Just like Wikipedia, our articles are written by many people. Everyone can make a big or small contribution. In this guide, you will learn how you can help make Activist Handbook better.

## The ‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô section

We actively encourage everyone to start editing Activist Handbook. We do this on every page, in the _‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô_ section. You can find this somewhere at the bottom of the page.

In this section, we give concrete suggestions on how you can make that specific page better. If you have suggestions on how a page can be made better but do not have the time or knowledge to do it yourself, we encourage you to add your suggestions to the _‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô_ section.

## Do I need permission to edit?

**No, Activist Handbook is as much yours as anyone else's!** You are allowed to edit our pages, without asking anyone for permission. However, there is a one thing to keep in mind:

**If you want to make big changes, first suggest these changes to others. Examples of big changes are:**

-   Moving articles to a new location
-   Deleting content
-   Creating a new page
-   Completely restructuring an article (Only if it already contains a lot of content. If it is still empty, you do not need to talk with others first.)

**You can suggest your changes to others by adding them in the** _**‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô**_ **section.**

## Do not go for perfect

It is easy to get stuck spending a lot of time working on your improvements and trying to deliver perfect work. This is not the right approach.

We have the following recommendations:

-   **‚úÖ Do** add the results of your work to Activist Handbook straight away.
-   **‚úÖ Do** make small improvements over time.
-   **‚ùå Do not** spend days doing research without updating Activist Handbook.
-   **‚ùå Do not** try to deliver perfect all at once.

If you take on too much by yourself all at once, you will likely give up halfway and not publish anything anything at all. It is better to work in small steps and share updates frequently. This also makes it easier for others to see what you are working on and build upon your work.

## How can I improve pages?

There are 6 ways for you to make Activist Handbook guides better:

1.  Integrate external resources
2.  Add more external resources
3.  Find out what people look up
4.  Translate existing guides
5.  Localise content
6.  Follow on-page instructions

Read on to learn more about each.

### 1\. Integrate external resources

#### Creative Commons = reusable

All the way at the bottom of every page, we have a list of _external resources._ These are materials such as guides, books and videos that we have found outside of Activist Handbook.

Some of these resources are available under a Creative Commons licence. This means we can freely reuse them as long as we give attribution to the original author (and sometimes other conditions).

#### We ‚Äòsteal‚Äô other people's work

We want to integrate all those resources with Activist Handbook. Sometimes we merge (combine) them with existing guides on Activist Handbook. Other times, there is no guide about that topic yet, so we create a new page and copy & paste their contents to Activist Handbook.

In other words: **we ‚Äòsteal‚Äô their content for the purpose of making it better.** At the same time, we welcome everyone to 'steal' our work back. We also publish everything under a Creative Commons licence.

This is why we ‚Äòsteal‚Äô other people's work:

-   **By putting it on Activist Handbook, anyone can start improving it.** Usually, other websites do not make it possible (or easy) for people to edit pages.
-   **By merging it with other guides, we take the best from each.** Often, guides are written with the perspective and experience of one person. By combining various resources, we can create something better.
-   **By putting it on Activist Handbook, it becomes part of a much larger collection of guides.** Often, it is not possible to go into much detail within a single guide. On Activist Handbook we can link to many other guides. This also means that each of our guides can be more focused: not everything has to be discussed in that one guide. We can simply link to other guides.

### 2\. Add more external resources

#### Steps of doing research

Doing research is a skill you have to learn. If you have a process that works well for you, feel free to use that method. But if you are not sure, follow these steps to do research for Activist Handbook:

1.  **Make a list of resources about the topic (max 10 minutes).** Include everything you find, it does not matter if they are any good or not. Just have a quick glance (10 seconds) at each resource, do not start reading everything yet. Add these resources to the ‚ÄòExternal resources‚Äô section of the guide.
2.  **Quickly review the resources on your list (max 30 minutes).** Spend 1 minute per resource to find out what it is about. Only look at the introduction, the headings and the conclusion. Write down 10 words or so per resource to describe what it includes and whether it contains valuable information that is relevant to the guide you are working on. Update your list in the ‚ÄòExternal resources' section (maybe delete resources if they add no value at all) and add your notes to the ‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô section.
3.  **Find out how you can use the resources on your list (max 1 hour).** Focus on the resources that you think contain the most valuable information. For each, write down in bullet points how you think the insights from that resource can be integrated with Activist Handbook. Add these notes to the ‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô section.

During your research process, you will likely come across many resources that are valuable for activists, but not necessarily relevant to the guide you are working on. Feel free to improve multiple guides at the same time.

#### Places to find resources

Here are some places where you can find external resources:

-   **üîç Use Google.** Ok, this one might sound obvious. But with these tips & tricks, you will find better resources:
    -   Add the words ‚Äòactivism‚Äô or ‚Äònonprofit‚Äô behind your search query: ‚Äò_social media activism‚Äô_, _‚Äòfunding nonprofit‚Äô_.
    -   Search a specific website: ‚Äò_organise protest site:commonslibrary.org_‚Äô
-   **üîó Search within specific websites and books.** Check out our [resources](/resources) chapter for a list of the best websites to find information about activism.
-   **üëÄ Use the resources that you already have as a starting point.** Maybe they contain links to other valuable resources. And maybe the publisher or author of the resource has created more useful resources on the topic.

### 3\. Find out what people look up

We use [search engine research (SEO)](/tools/seo) to write better content for Activist Handbook. That might sound complex, but in this section, we explain in easy words how you can make use of this too.

In every ‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô section, we also list some search queries that are related to that guide. For each, we say how many people look up that search query per month. We use this information to determine what challenges activists face most and what words they use to find solutions.

-   **‚úÖ Do** improve and add new content about popular search queries.
-   ‚úÖ **Do** slightly rephrase titles to match the terminology used by activists.
-   **‚ùå Do not** randomly try to put as many popular keywords in a guide.

### 4\. Translate existing guides

### 5\. Localise content

### 6\. Follow on-page instructions

Have a look at the ‚ÄòImprove this page' section. Every page has different needs. Sometimes it needs to be restructured. Sometimes the language used is too difficult.
