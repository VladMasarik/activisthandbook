## **Content organisation**

Activist Handbook consists of pages which can be _**chapters**_, _**articles**_ or _**sub-articles**_.

The topic you write can be very complex and elaborate, but the **pages** you write them on should not be. We heard from our readers that having sub-pages and links works better than putting every piece of information on a single page.

Depending on the topics you cover, you can create additional pages if you want to get into more detail, or if you want to highlight something for further exploration in the future.

For a more detailed guide on how to structure your article within pages, check out the Content circle guide about [page templates](/support/writers/structure).
