## Adding resources

> Examples of correctly formatting external resources:
> 
> -   [Name of article](#) by Author (2020) | [View in archive](#)
> -   [Book: Name of book](#) by Author (2020)
> -   [Video: Name of video](#) \[French\] by Author (2020)
> -   [Name of resource](#) by Author (no date)

The first step when writing a new article is to collect resources. Resources can be external articles, books, movies, and more. Here are a few tips when collecting resources:

-   **Make clear what kind of resource it is** by adding the type in the title. We do not usually indicate if it is an article, as this is the default.
-   **Make clear what in what language(s) the resource is available** when it is in a different language than the page it is on. Add it between brackets after the title like so: \[German\]
-   **Make sure to archive the resource.** This way, even if the original link breaks (for example, when the link changes or the page is deleted), users will still be able to access the resource. Use [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org) to archive web pages.

## Captioning illustrations

When you add an illustration you will be given an option to edit the captions at the bottom. We recommend the following format of the caption:

<div><figcaption><a href="#">Image title</a> by Author (Year)</figcaption></div>

## Footnotes

We prefer not to use footnotes, as they make a text hard to read. However, if you still want to use them (for example if you are reusing existing work), follow these guidelines:

When writing articles, we might want to explain certain concepts, use of words, or stress a caveat. You can use either asterisk (\*) or numbers (1) (2) … (n) in case you will be using multiple footnotes. The related footnotes are placed at the bottom of the main article, before chapters and other links in the section titled “Footnotes”.
