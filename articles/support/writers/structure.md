**Within this article we will explain the basic contents that (ideally) every article or page on the website is following. These guidelines make sure our chapters are well structured and easy to navigate. We want our readers to familiarise with Activist Handbook easily**

## Page template

Every article should contain the following:

### **1\. Title**

The title should be short and clearly announce what the article or page is about. We strongly advise you not to make it a sentence or a question and to keep it under 30 characters.

Example: How to organise protest

### 2\. Subtitle

The subtitle should contain additional keywords that people might search for when looking for the article or page. But remember that the subtitle is not just for search engine optimization, it also has to be relevant for website visitors.

Example: Guide on how to organise demonstration

### 3\. Short overview

The overview (in bold) should outline the contents of the article or page, explain what it is about and why it might (not) be relevant for the reader. This section also contains disclaimers about the state of the article (complete, under construction, flagged for review etc.) Recommended length for the introduction is one paragraph.

Example:

**In this guide, you will learn how to organise a protest or demonstration. This article for activists explains step by step how to organise an action to draw attention to your cause.**

### 4\. Introduction topic (optional)

Underneath the overview, you should illustrate what the article or page is about using examples, a short engaging story or an illustration.

### 5\. Subtopics (optional)

If the topic is too complex to fit in one page, make sure to break the article into multiple pages and link the related pages directly underneath the introduction. Subtopics always use the following linking structure "activishandbook.org/main-topic/sub-topic".

### 6\. Page content

This is the main content of your article or page.

### 7\. Improve this page

Encourage people to contribute to the page. Try to insert creative calls to actions when appropriate. Are we looking for more resources? Are we looking for a specific perspective on the topic? How could people want to engage with the article you are writing?

### 8\. Footnotes (discouraged)

When you do not want to obstruct the main content with a comment, you can add it in the footnotes.

### 9\. Related articles

To make it easier for activists to find the information they are looking for on this site, add a list of related articles at the bottom of each page. These articles can be from a different chapter.

### 10\. External resources

This is a section where you can list all the external resources that are relevant to the topic but not yet covered in the article you are writing.

### 11\. Attribution

In this section we give credit to authors. This is particularly useful when reusing Creative Commons articles, or when articles have been written in partnership with other organisations.
