**This chapter contains a list of various tactics that activists use to make change happen. Note that you do not have to choose one particular tactic. The most successful movements use a combination of tactics and allow people to contribute to the cause in their own way.**

> Start organising small, build towards something big. Radical change starts small. If you would like to learn how to become the spark that ignites the fire, also make sure to check out our [organising chapter](/organising).

## Choose your tactic

You should pick your tactics based on your [strategy](/strategy). To help you get started, we created four broad categories. Tactics may fall under multiple categories. Also make sure to read our guide on how to [choosing your tactic](/tactics/choose).

## List of tactics

### **Protests ‚úä**

Protesting is great way to attract the attention of the public, either by gathering a large crowd or by doing something out of the ordinary.

**Topics:** [March](/tactics/march) | [Flash mob](/tactics/flash-mob) | [Occupation](/tactics/occupation) | [Direct action](/tactics/direct-action) | [Civil disobedience](/tactics/civil-disobedience) | [Cultural disobedience](/tactics/cultural-disobedience) | [Human banner](/tactics/human-banner) | [Cacerolazo](/tactics/cacerolazo) | [Hunger strike](/tactics/hunger-strike) | [Banner drop](/tactics/banner-drop) | [Citizen's arrest](/tactics/citizens-arrest) | [Distributed action](/tactics/distributed-action) | [Hoax](/tactics/hoax) | [Lamentation (mourning)](https://beautifulrising.org/tool/lamentation) | Walking blockade

### **Creative üé®**

Activism can be beautiful. By using creative tactics you can make your movement stand out from the crowd.

There are many ways of digital activism. Some of them include sharing pictures and stories, building a network or sharing a certain hashtag, getting as many people as possible to sign a petition.

**Topics:** [Petitions](/tactics/petition) | [Hacktivism](/tactics/hacktivism)

Sometimes having a conversation is better than shouting slogans. Informational tactics are there to start a public debate about certain topics, in the hope that the outcome of the debate will lead to societal change.

By joining existing institutions one can make change happen from within. Institutional tactics create societal change while following the rules of the existing system.

**Topics:** [Voting](/organising/frameworks/elections) | [Running for office](/tactics/running-for-office) | [Judicial](/tactics/judicial) | [Corporate](/tactics/corporate)

**Topics:** [Boycott](/tactics/boycot) | [Divestment](/tactics/divestment) | [Shareholder](/tactics/shareholder)

> ‚ÄúA good tactic is one that **your people enjoy**. If your people are not having a ball doing it, there is something very wrong with the tactic.‚Äù

> Saul Alinsky (Rules for Radicals, p.94)
