**Canvassing is a way of talking directly with potential supporters of your cause. Often, this happens by going door to door and starting a conversation.**

Door to door canvassing is a powerful way for activists to connect with their communities and grow their movements. It allows activists to share their message and get feedback from community members on the issues that matter to them.

One important thing to keep in mind when canvassing is to be respectful of people's time and space. Make sure to introduce yourself and explain why you're there, and be prepared to listen to people's concerns. If someone doesn't want to talk to you, respect their decision and move on.

Canvassing can be an effective way to build relationships with community members and get them involved in your movement. It's also a great way to collect information about the issues that matter to people in your community.

If you're interested in starting a canvassing program in your community, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First, you'll need to recruit volunteers and create a training program so that everyone is familiar with the basics of canvassing. You'll also need to develop a strategy for reaching people in your community.

Finally, you'll need to find a way to fund your canvassing campaign. It probably won't cost a lot, but you will still need to buy some flyers.
