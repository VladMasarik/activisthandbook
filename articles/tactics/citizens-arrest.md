Citizen's arrest is the process of detaining someone who has committed a crime, in order to hand them over to the police. It can be a powerful tool for activists, as it allows them to take action against criminals in their community, without having to rely on the police.

However, citizen's arrest can also be a dangerous thing to do, and should only be attempted if you are absolutely sure that the person you are arresting has committed a crime. This guide will teach you how to safely and effectively carry out a citizen's arrest.
