## About this strategy

On the left side of the diagram are strategies that focus primarily on the people and communities, not the institutions. The more lenient type is what we named _**Cultural**_ strategies. These focus on training, education, awareness campaigns, information dissemination etc. Their primary goal is to strengthen individuals and communities, change behaviour, values or attitudes of people.
