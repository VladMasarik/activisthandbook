**In this guide, you will learn how to organise an occupation or blockade. The act of blocking a certain space has been used by many activists as an effective non-violent action tactic. An occupation protest is quite disruptive and can be categorised as a form of civil disobedience.**

The goal of this guide is to provide you with the tools and resources you need to successfully organise and carry out an occupation or blockade. Blocking a space can be an extremely effective way to bring attention to your cause and protest an injustice. It can also be a powerful way to mobilise people and raise awareness about an issue.

An occupation can take on many different forms, but all have the same goal: to disrupt business as usual and bring attention to the issue at hand. It is important to remember that an occupation is a form of civil disobedience, which means that there is always some risk involved. However, with careful [planning and organisation](/organising), this risk can be minimised.

In this guide, you will learn about the different types of occupations, the steps involved in planning and organising an occupation, and the best ways to execute it. You will also learn about the [legal rights of protesters](/rights) and how to handle encounters with the police.
