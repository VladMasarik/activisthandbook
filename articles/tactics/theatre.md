Performance has always been a powerful tool for activists. From secret shows to street protests, theatre can be a powerful way to get a message across and mobilise people. But with the current political landscape, is theatre still an effective form of activism?

There’s no doubt that performance can have a mass impact beyond a grassroots level. It can be used to mobilise people, raise awareness and even change public opinion. But it’s not always easy to achieve these goals. It takes skill and creativity to produce theatre that is both engaging and effective.
