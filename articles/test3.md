## In short

A successful demonstration -- one that accomplishes its goals either immediately or over the long term, and that runs the way organizers envisioned -- depends upon clarity of purpose, getting people there, getting the message to those who need to hear it, and leaving a sense of success and support for the issue with your target audience, your constituents, the public, and the media.
