**In this article, we discuss the following question: does activism work? We look at effective protests in the past, and we talk about what kind of activism is the most effective.**

In the past few years, activism has become more and more popular. With the rise of social media, it has become easier for people to raise awareness and get involved in causes they care about. But is activism actually effective?

There is no easy answer to this question. It depends on a lot of factors, including the issue you're fighting for, the resources you have, and the amount of support you can rally.

That being said, there are many examples of activism that have resulted in positive change. For example, the #MeToo movement has led to a greater awareness of sexual assault and harassment and has resulted in more women feeling comfortable coming forward with their stories.

The bottom line is that activism can be effective, but it's not always easy. It takes dedication, hard work, and a lot of luck. But if you're passionate about a cause and willing to put in the effort, it can be a powerful tool for change.
