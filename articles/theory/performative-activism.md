The article discusses performative activism, which is when people join activist movements not because they believe in the cause but because they want to be famous. This often occurs online, where people post messages saying they support a cause but do nothing else to actually support it. Most performative activists are deliberately deceiving the public, but some may sincerely care about the cause.
