This app is popular in many parts of the world. It is owned by Facebook and does not provide proper security and privacy features. If it is possible to convince your fellow activists to use a different app, consider switching to a more privacy friendly alternative such as [WhatsApp](/tools/chat-apps/whatsapp) or [Signal](/tools/chat-apps/signal).

> **TL;DR:** Facebook Messenger is one of the worst options when it comes to privacy. Activist Handbook recommends activists not to use it. Check out our reviews of [other chat-apps](/tools/chat-apps).

## **Security and privacy**

Messenger does not use [end-to-end encryption](/end-to-end-encryption) by default and it's developer, Facebook, does not have a good reputation on privacy either. The chat app is not open source. Do not use this app if you need privacy.

## **Price and revenue model**

The app is freely available, at the cost of having Facebook collect data about you so that they can sell their personalised adds. There are advertisements in the app as well.
