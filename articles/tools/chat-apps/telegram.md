Telegram is an open source messaging app. It works for one-to-one conversations, but it also allows for massive communities.

The app has gained significant popularity among activists, partly because of privacy concerns with competitors such as WhatsApp. However, security experts do not recommend Telegram (because of the use of [non-standardised encryption methods](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49782/is-telegram-secure) and the [lack of end-to-end encryption](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/telegram-privacy-security/38444/) by default). This does not necessarily mean you should not use the app. Just do not switch to the app for the wrong reasons.

> **TL;DR:** Telegram offers great features for large movements. However, it one of the least secure and privacy friendly options out there. Also make sure to check out our [reviews of other chats apps](/tools/chat-apps).

## **Popularity**

Compared to the big giants, Telegram has a relatively small number of users, but usage among activists is more common.
