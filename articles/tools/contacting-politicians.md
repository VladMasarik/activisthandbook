Open source tools that you can host yourself (requires some developer background):

-   [Contact Congress (Open Source)](https://github.com/EFForg/contact-congress) - Send emails to members of the US Congress. This was developed by EFF as an open source project. They use it for their own campaigns internally. There is also a hosted version run by Fight for the Future (see below).
-   [Call Congress](https://github.com/fightforthefuture/call-congress) - Coordinate call-in days to US Congress, the President, or local or corporate targets. Original project from Fight for the Future and Taskforce.is, but with lots of development from [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/call-congress) and the [EFF](https://github.com/effOrg/call-congress/tree/refactor/master). Frontend looks like this, [https://call.mozilla.org](https://call.mozilla.org/) and the backend looks like [http://callpower.org](http://callpower.org/easy-to-use/). A hosted version is available, and the code is AGPL.
