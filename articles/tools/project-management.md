**Project management tools can be really useful for activists, as they help keep track of all to-do's and communications. One of our favourites is** [**Trello**](https://trello.com) **- it's easy to use and helps you work together with lots of people.**

For example, you could create a board for a protest, and add cards for each task that needs to be done. You can then invite other people to join the board, and collaborate on tasks. This can be really helpful for [organising actions](/organising/action) and ensuring everyone is on the same page.
