The United Nations (UN) is an international organisation that almost every country in the world is a member of. It is the main platform where global international politics plays out, but it is not any sort of “world government”. This means that, instead of passing bills, it passes resolutions. While bills seek to change laws (which are binding), resolutions are seen by most experts as non-binding (e.g. Higgins 1994).

The United Nations created the [International Bill of Human Rights](/rights/international-bill-of-human-rights), which includes a number of protections for activists.
