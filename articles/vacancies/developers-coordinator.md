**Activist Handbook is expanding the coordination team! We are looking for a Developers Coordinator (8 hours per week) who will be leading open source software projects.**

As **Developers Coordinator**, you will contribute our web platforms. You will work closely together with your developers team and the other coordinators. Read more about this position below.

> **Interested? Apply by filling in** [**our form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6BUIpvW-0dBthpOIaQAkgallz-UTovZ9YJ1HjIoge6iOGKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)**.**

> Feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding this position: [contact@activisthandbook.org](mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org)

_We believe that diversity strengthens our organisation. That is why we encourage people of all genders, sexual preferences and ethnic backgrounds, including people with disabilities, to join our cause!_

## **What will you be doing?**

We use the open source [WikiJS](https://wiki.js.org) software base to power our main website. You will help us adapt the platform to our needs, and you will actively help Nicolas Giard, the main contributor, using GitHub issues and pull requests.

In addition, you will help developing [Rebel Tools](https://rebel.tools), our free to use platform for small movements to organise themselves more effectively. You will do this together with your fellow team members.

## **Who are we looking for?**

-   You wholeheartedly agree with our [principles](/about/principles).
-   You have some experience as an activist, are politically involved _or have shown interest in changing our society for the better in **any other way**_.
-   You are not afraid to take initiative and are eager to learn. Having some experience with VueJS or another Javascript framework is a pro, but not a requirement.
-   You like working in a team. You understand leading is not about telling people what to do but enabling them to come to their full potential.

## **What are we offering?**

-   You will get to grow your network and make lots of new international friends.
-   You will work together with a close team of enthusiastic and motivated volunteers who are not afraid to think big.
-   You will be able to learn everything about effective change-making from experienced activists from all over the world. You will learn transferrable skills in organising, technology, people skills and many other areas relevant to personal and professional life.
