**This chapter is meant as a guide on how to safeguard the wellbeing of activists. In the process of trying to make a change, you might forget about your own wellbeing. You will learn how why the wellbeing of you and your fellow change-makers is vital for the long term effectiveness of your movement.**

👉 Need help now? Check out [**Wellbeing Hotlines**](/wellbeing/hotlines) and XR's [**Don't Panic guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10UbkxVAUVBJt0xtS_uE78LXCV8QeFwvW76BB6T_ZSok/edit)**.**

## Introduction

Many activists struggle with their mental and physical health, or see how the wellbeing of fellow change-makers is affected by activism. You might experience stress because you feel your contributions do not create any significant change. You might feel disappointed with yourself for not doing enough, or you feel helpless because others are not doing enough. You might fear being infiltrated by police or oppositional activists groups, and are not sure anymore who to trust.

This chapter is about acknowledging those difficulties and providing help for those who need it. In addition, we will talk about how to prevent mental and physical health issues. As so well put by Håkan Geijer: “Be gentle with each other so we can be dangerous together.”
