This book is a companion to the book [Riot Medicine](/wellbeing/riot-medicine) and is intended to be used as a field guide for riot medics. It does not cover theory, and it does not have detailed explanations or clarifications of terms or treatments. Reading this book without first reading Riot Medicine can endanger patients. Neither this book nor Riot Medicine are substitutes for formal training.

This book is short and meant to be carried in your bag as a quick reference if you find yourself needing to double check signs, symptoms, or treatment. Ideally most of this information should be memorized.
